# Bastior Prime — Planetary Crusade Campaign

## Planet Classification
Imperial Fortress World

## Campaign Scope
This Crusade campaign represents a planet-scale conflict fought across key strategic zones on Bastior Prime.
Each zone is controlled independently and provides in-battle effects to the controlling faction.

## Control Levels
Zones use the following control thresholds:
- 0% — Uncontrolled
- 25% — Contested
- 75% — Dominant Control
- 100% — Full Control

Zone effects become active immediately upon reaching the listed control threshold.

## Planetary Victory Conditions
A faction wins the Bastior Prime campaign if it achieves one of the following:
- Controls **4 of 5 zones at 100%**, or
- Controls **all 5 zones at 75% or higher** at the end of a campaign round.

## Planetary Scar Rule
If a faction loses control of Bastior Prime entirely, the planet gains a permanent Planetary Scar
that applies to all future campaigns fought here.
