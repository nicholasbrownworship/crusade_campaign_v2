# Bastior Prime – Planetary Crusade Map

## Planet Type
Imperial Fortress World

## Campaign Scope
This Crusade campaign represents a focused war for control of Bastior Prime itself.
Battles are fought over key planetary zones rather than across multiple worlds.

## Zone Control
- Each zone is controlled independently.
- Zones use standard control levels: 0 / 25 / 75 / 100.
- Control effects apply immediately when thresholds are reached.

## Planetary Victory
A faction wins the Bastior Prime campaign if it controls:
- **4 of 5 zones at 100%**, or
- **All 5 zones at 75% or higher** simultaneously.

## Planetary Scar Rule
If a faction loses control of Bastior Prime entirely, the planet gains a permanent
**Planetary Scar** that affects all future campaigns fought here.
