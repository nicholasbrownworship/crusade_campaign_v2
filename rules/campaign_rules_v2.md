Crusade Campaign Layer v2
Bastior Sub-Sector Campaign Rules
1. Campaign Premise

The Bastior Sub-Sector is a contested war zone divided between three major powers. Each faction seeks to expand its influence, secure strategic worlds, and deny its enemies critical resources. Battles fought using Warhammer 40,000 Crusade rules directly shape the strategic map, permanently altering the balance of power in the sub-sector.

This campaign emphasizes territorial control, long-term consequences, and narrative escalation rather than raw win-loss records.

2. Factions & Roles

The campaign features three factions:

Defenders – The established power holding core territories at campaign start.

Attackers – An organized invading force seeking to seize and fortify worlds.

Raiders – A destabilizing force focused on disruption, opportunistic conquest, and chaos.

Each faction acts as a team, not as individual players. Victories contribute to faction control rather than personal ownership.

3. Territories & Control States

Each territory exists in one of four control states:

0% Control – No faction holds meaningful influence.

25% Control – A foothold has been established.

75% Control – Dominant presence, but not fully secure.

100% Control – Full control and stabilization.

Control represents logistics, population compliance, orbital dominance, and infrastructure — not just battlefield success.

4. Attacking & Defending Territories
Choosing a Target

A faction may attack one adjacent or narratively connected territory per campaign round.

Territories marked as Safe may not be attacked.

Battle Resolution

Each battle adjusts control as follows:

If the Attacker wins:

Territory control shifts one step toward the attacker:

0 → 25

25 → 100

75 (Defender) → 0 (Defender loses all control)

If the Defender wins:

Control shifts one step back toward the defender:

25 → 0

75 → 100

If a defender wins while at 75%, the territory becomes Safe.

Only one control step may change per battle.

5. Safe Territories & Cooldowns

A Safe Territory represents a world that has repelled invasion and stabilized its defenses.

Safe territories cannot be attacked for one full campaign round.

At the end of that round, the Safe status is removed, but control remains at 100%.

A territory may only become Safe by:

A defender victory while at 75% control.

This prevents repeated grinding of the same world and encourages strategic expansion.

6. Territory Effects & Strategic Roles

Each territory has a Strategic Role (e.g., Forge World, Shrine World, Warp Nexus).

At 75% Control: the controlling faction gains a Minor Effect.

At 100% Control: the controlling faction gains a Major Effect.

Effects are campaign-level bonuses, narrative permissions, or strategic advantages — not raw stat inflation whenever possible.

7. Territory Scars (Persistent Consequences)

When a territory changes hands at 100% Control, it gains a Scar.

Scars represent lasting damage, corruption, or instability and persist even if the territory is later reclaimed.

Examples:

Ruined Infrastructure

Tainted Manufactorums

Population Unrest

Warp Instability

A territory may have multiple scars, making repeated battles meaningful and dangerous.

8. Campaign Rounds

A campaign round consists of:

Target declaration

Battles played

Control updates

Safe territory resolution

Narrative update

Campaign pacing should favor fewer, meaningful battles over constant skirmishing.

9. Victory Conditions

The campaign ends when one faction achieves one of the following:

Controls all Core Territories at 100%.

Controls X total territories at 100% (recommended: 50–60% of the map).

A narrative end condition is reached (GM-defined).

Victory should be framed as a narrative climax, not an abrupt stop.

10. Design Intent (Read This Once)

This campaign layer is designed to:

Reward strategic planning

Prevent grind and stalemates

Create persistent narrative consequences

Make the map feel alive and reactive

Every battle should matter.
